This is the code for the new KFly PCB.

HW Specs:
* ARM Cortex-M4F STM32F405 CPU w/ FPU and DSP @ 168MHz
* MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope
* HMC5883L magnetometer
* MS5611-01BA01 pressure sensor
* 8 PWM outputs (50/400Hz)
* 4 expansion connectors (3 UARTs & 1 CAN)
* 6 slot RC input connector with support for (C)PPM up to 8 channels in and signal strength

SW Specs:
* Runs FreeRTOS (with FPU support) with an Hardware Abstraction Layer on top for fast application development
* USB Bootloader - no need for an external programmer!
* Quaternion based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) provides attitude estimation
* "Control signal to Motor"-mixing for different types of frames
* Flight control: Rate mode, Attitude mode and more to come
